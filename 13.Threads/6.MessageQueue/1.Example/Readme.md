Hi everyoneðŸ˜„

In this example I used MessageQueues in VSCode on Windows OSðŸ’»

POSIX Message Queues don't work on the Windows OS. So, how did I do this?? Let's explain every stepðŸŒž

1. I installed the WSL on my Windows OSâœ…
2. I downloaded the Ubuntu Terminal from the Microsoft Storeâœ…
3. Open the Ubuntu terminal and go to into the file where you want to work with "cd" commandâœ…
4. Open the VSCode in the Ubuntu Terminal using "code ." commandâœ…

When you work this example, open two terminal and write the commands to the each termianl like thisðŸ”½
