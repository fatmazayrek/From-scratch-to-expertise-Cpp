Hi everyone🙂

I continued the MessageQueue topic🙋‍♀️

This example is similar to 1.Example. I added the function that getting the attributes of messagequeue in the receiver.c file🔽

Also you can easily understand the structure of the message queues with this example✅

When you write messages into the message queue. They are sorted by the priority numbers🔢

When you start the receiver code after writing messages more than once, You can easliy see the current messages into the message queue🌀

If you continue running the receiver code, you will see decreasing the current messages into the messagequeue🔽

I hope it helps your studies🌞
